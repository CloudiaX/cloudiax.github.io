							<h1 class="major">Computational Design and Fabrication</h1>
							
							<p class="thin">Inspired by the previous research of pop-ups from the Graphics and Geometric Computing Group at Tsinghua University, I proposed the idea of the computational design of transforming pop-ups and was advised by Professor Shi-min Hu and Professor Kun Xu. I was drawn towards the interesting nature of this problem and its potential for yielding new knowledge. Starting from scratch, I spent a month studying the principles behind it, and then analyzed the geometric properties used in transforming pop-ups. Based on this investigation, a novel mathematical model was built by integrating knowledge from mechanical engineering and geometry. I led the project team that developed the first computational design tool to help novice users create transforming pop-ups.</br></p>
							

							<h3>Question Posing</h3>
							<p class="thin"><span class="image right" style="width:22em;"><img src="images/img01.JPG"  alt=""/></span>Not only children but also adults love transforming pop-up books because of its surprising and playful mechanisms. To find out how to build the structure of it, we analyzed the mechanisms used in “Transformers: The Ultimate Pop-up Universe” and defined several properties of transforming pop-up:</br>
							<ul style="clear:both;">
								<li>Every structure consists of a pull-tab, a ground patch, and several basic 4R linkage mechanisms.</li>
								<li>Every structure has only one DoF, which guarantees it could transform into a specified shape.</li>
								<li>The structure is foldable at both initial state and ending state of transformation.</li>
								<li>No collisions during the transformation process.</li>
							</ul></p>
							
							<p class="thin">After listing above properties, we posed the question that is how to automatically generate a structure that has above properties and can transform between two patterns and shapes.
							</p>



							<h3>Question Decomposition</h3>
							<p class="thin">
							
							The question could be decomposed into several sub-questions, which helps us to solve it step by step.							
							 <br/>
							</p> 

							<p>1. Which kind of mechanisms can be used in transforming pop-up structures?</p>
							<p class="thin">There are three basic mechanisms based on the 4R linkages could be used in the structures: parallel mechanism, V-fold mechanism, and slide mechanism. There are also three kinds of functional elements: extended patch, ground patch and pull-tab.</p> 

							<p>2. How could we build a structure using these mechanisms?</p>
							<p class="thin">Three types of linkages, including hinge linkage, extended patch linkage, and slide linkage, are used in transforming pop-up structure to transmit movement from one mechanism to another, and the link relations can be naturally described as a tree structure.</p>

							<p>3. How could we ensure the structure only has one DoF and without collisions?</p>
							<p class="thin">The number of DoF can be proved by using Kutzbach-Gruebler Equation, and the proof details could be found in the supplemental material of our paper. We use a hard constraint to ensure the mechanisms remain collision-free when generating the structure.</p>

							<p>4. How could we measure the change of pattern textures?</p>
							<p class="thin">We observe that pattern texture could change due to face flipping or covering, so we introduce the flip term to measure that all regions change into target pattern.</p>

							<p>5. How could we measure the change of shape?</p>
							<p class="thin">The movements of mechanisms provide the shape change, so we introduce shape term to accounts for how well the pop-up in the untransformed and transformed states match the shapes of the user given source and target patterns.</p>




 


 



							<h3 style="clear:both;">Proposing Solutions</h3>
							<p class="thin">
							<span class="image fit" style="padding-right:3em;"><img src="images/img02.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							By answering these sub-questions, it is much more clear that what kind of methods can be used in the solution. Our overall algorithm has four steps: an optimization step, a patch refinement step, a texture painting step, and a blueprint generation step. Details could be found in Section 4 in <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="transforming.html" target="_blank">our paper</a>.

 							<h3 style="clear:both;">Results</h3>
							<p class="thin">
							Some results are given here. We also gave the evaluation which could be found in Section 5 in <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="transforming.html" target="_blank">our paper</a>.
